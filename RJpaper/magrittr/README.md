magrittr -  Ceci n'est pas un pipe.
====================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/smbache/magrittr.png?branch=dev)](https://travis-ci.org/smbache/magrittr)

# Introduction

The magrittr package offers a set of operators which promote semantics 
that will improve your code by

* structuring sequences of data operations left-to-right (as opposed to 
  from the inside and out),
* avoiding nested function calls, 
* minimizing the need for local variables and function definitions, and
* making it easy to add steps anywhere in the sequence of operations.

The operators pipe their left-hand side values forward into expressions that
appear on the right-hand side, i.e. one can replace `f(x)` with 
`x %>% f`, where `%>%` is the (main) pipe-operator. When coupling 
several function calls with the pipe-operator, the benefit will become
more apparent. Consider this pseudo example 


    the_data <-
      read.csv('/path/to/data/file.csv') %>%
      subset(variable_a > x) %>%
      transform(variable_c = variable_a/variable_b) %>%
      head(100)

Four operations are performed to 
arrive at the desired data set, and they are written in a natural order: 
the same as the order of execution. Also, no temporary variables are needed.
If yet another operation is required, it is straight-forward to add to the
sequence of operations wherever it may be needed.

# Installation

To install the current development version use devtools:

    devtools::install_github("smbache/magrittr")

To install the CRAN version:

    install.packages("magrittr")

# Features

### Basic piping: 
  
  * `x %>% f` is equivalent to `f(x)`
  * `x %>% f(y)` is equivalent to `f(x, y)`
  * `x %>% f %>% g %>% h` is equivalent to `h(g(f(x)))`

### The argument placeholder

 * `x %>% f(y, .)` is equivalent to `f(y, x)`
 * `x %>% f(y, z = .)` is equivalent to `f(y, z = x)`
 
### Re-using the placeholder for attributes

It is straight-forward to use the placeholder several times
in a right-hand side expression. However, when the placeholder
only appears in a nested expressions magrittr will still apply
the first-argument rule. The reason is that in most cases this
results more clean code. 

`x %>% f(y = nrow(.), z = ncol(.))` is equivalent to 
   `f(x, y = nrow(x), z = nrow(x))`

The behavior can be
overruled by enclosing the right-hand side in braces:

`x %>% {f(y = nrow(.), z = ncol(.))}` is equivalent to 
   `f(y = nrow(x), z = nrow(x))`

### More advanced right-hand sides and lambdas
To define a unary function on the fly in the pipeline, enclose the
body of such function in braces, and refer to the argument as
`.`, e.g. 


    iris %>% 
      {
        n <- sample(1:10, size = 1)
        H <- head(., n)
        T <- tail(., n)
        rbind(H, T)
      } %>%
      summary

### Building (unary) functions

Any pipeline starting with the `.` will return a function which can later
be used to apply the pipeline to values. Building functions in magrittr 
is therefore similar to building other values.


    f <- . %>% cos %>% sin 
    # is equivalent to 
    f <- function(.) sin(cos(.)) 


### Tee operations
Some right-hand sides are used for their side effect (e.g. plotting, 
printing to a file, etc) and it may be convenient to be able to 
subsequently continue the pipeline. The "tee" operator, `%T>%`
can be used for this purpose and works exactly like `%>%`, except it
returns the left-hand side value, rather than the potential result 
of the right-hand side operation:

    rnorm(200) %>%
    matrix(ncol = 2) %T>%
    plot %>% # plot usually does not return anything.
    colSums

### Pipe with exposition of variables
Many functions accept a data argument, e.g. `lm` and `aggregate`, which
is very useful in a pipeline where data is first processed and then passed
into such a function. There are also functions that do not have a data 
argument, for which it is useful to expose the variables in the data.
This is done with the `%$%` operator:

    iris %>%
      subset(Sepal.Length > mean(Sepal.Length)) %$%
      cor(Sepal.Length, Sepal.Width)

    data.frame(z = rnorm(100)) %$%
      ts.plot(z)

### Compound assignment pipe operations
There is also a pipe operator which can be used as shorthand notation
in situations where the left-hand side is being "overwritten":

    iris$Sepal.Length <- 
      iris$Sepal.Length %>%
      sqrt

To avoid the repetition of the left-hand side immediately after the assignment
operator, use the `%<>%` operator:

    iris$Sepal.Length %<>% sqrt 

This operator works exactly like `%>%`, except the pipeline assigns the result
rather than returning it. It must be the first pipe operator in a longer chain.
